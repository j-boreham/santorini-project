# santorini-project

Playable implementation of the Board Game Santorini with minimax AI implemented.

The game is packaged as a runnable JAR file which should play from the command line via the instructions.

The default game is one of a human vs the AI the human plays first.

To change this to AI vs AI enter X on start up.
